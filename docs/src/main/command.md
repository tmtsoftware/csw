## Command based communication between components

A component can send @ref:[Commands](services/messages/commands.md) to other components. The commands can be sent as following 
two types of messages: 

* **Submit** - A command is sent as Submit when the result of completion is desired.
* **Oneway** - A command is sent as Oneway when the result of completion is not desired.

Following responses could be received as a `CommandResponse` after sending a command :
 
* **Accepted** : The command is validated and will be executed
* **Invalid** : The command is not valid and will not be executed 
* **CompletedWithResult** : The command is executed successfully and generated some result
* **Completed** : The command has been executed successfully
* **NoLongerValid** : The command can no longer be executed
* **Error** : The command has failed in execution
* **Cancelled** : The command was cancelled
* **CommandNotAvailable** : The queried command is not available
* **NotAllowed** : The command cannot be executed currently because of the current state of the destination component. Eg 
another command is in execution in the presence of which it cannot accept any other command to execute.

A command sent as `Submit` or `Oneway` is validated by the receiving component before actual execution. If the validation is successful, 
the actual execution can happen in two ways :

* **Immediate** - The component receiving the command can determine if the command can be executed immediately and thus provide the
final execution response directly without sending a response for validation.

Java
:   @@snip [JCommandIntegrationTest.java](../../../csw-framework/src/test/java/csw/framework/command/JCommandIntegrationTest.java) { #immediate-response }

* **Long running** - The component receiving the command can determine if the command can not be executed immediately. In this case, the 
component provides a `Accepted` response as an acknowledgement and maintains the state of the command. The sender can query the state of 
a particular command or subscribe to get the final response when the execution is completed.

The sender component can send following commands to the receiver component with the command id (RunId) of the command being sent originally to 
get the completion status and/or result of the command

* **Query** - Query the current state of the command

## CommandService

The command service for a component can be obtained by creating an instance of `CommandService` using the `AkkaLocation`
of the component discovered using location service. This command service instance will have methods for communicating with 
the component using commands.
The API can be exercised as follows for different scenarios of command based communication:

### submit
Submit a command and get a `CommandResponse` as a Future. The CommandResponse can be a response of validation Completed or other Response.

### oneway
Send a command as a Oneway and get a `CommandResponse` as a Future. The CommandResponse can be a response of validation (Accepted, Invalid) or a final Response.

### subscribe
Subscribe for the result of a long running command which was sent as Submit to get a `CommandResponse` as a Future.

### query
Query for the result of a long running command which was sent as Submit to get a `CommandResponse` as a Future.

### submitAndSubscribe
Submit a command and Subscribe for the result if it was successfully validated as `Accepted` to get a final `CommandResponse` as a Future.

Scala
:   @@snip [CommandServiceTest.scala](../../../csw-framework/src/multi-jvm/scala/csw/framework/command/LongRunningCommandTest.scala) { #submitAndSubscribe }

Java

### onewayAndMatch
Send a command and match the published state from the component using a `StateMatcher`. If the match is successful a `Completed` response is provided as a future. 
In case of a failure or unmatched state, `Error` CommandResponse is provided as a Future.

### submitAllAndGetResponse
Submit multiple commands and get one CommandResponse as a Future of `CommandResponse` for all commands. If all the commands were successful, a CommandResponse 
as `Completed` will be returned. If any one of the command fails, an `Error` will be returned.

### submitAllAndGetFinalResponse
Submit multiple commands and get final CommandResponse for all as one CommandResponse. If all the commands were successful, a CommandResponse as `Completed` will be 
returned. If any one of the command fails, an `Error` will be returned. For long running commands, it will subscribe for the result of those which were successfully 
validated as `Accepted` and get the final CommandResponse.

Java

### subscribeCurrentState
This method can be used to subscribe to the @ref:[CurrentState](services/messages/states.md) of the component by providing a 
callback. Subscribing results into a handle of `CurrentStateSubscription` which can be used to unsubscribe the subscription.

## Matching state for command completion

A `Matcher` is provided for matching state against a desired state. The matcher is created with a source of state identified
by its ActorRef and an instance of `StateMatcher` which defines the state and criteria for matching. Several instances of 
`StateMatcher` are available for common use. These are `DemandMatcherAll` for matching the entire `DemandState` against the current state,
`DemandMatcher` for matching state with or without units against the current state and `PresenceMatcher` which checks if a 
matching state is found with a provided prefix.

## Distributing commands

`CommandDistributor` is a utility for distributing commands to multiple components and get an aggregated response. 

### aggregated validation response

A component can send one or more commands to one or more components using a `Map[ComponentRef, Set[ControlCommand]`, and get an aggregated response 
of validation as `Accepted` if all the commands were successfully validated. An `Error` response is returned otherwise

### aggregated completion response

A component can send one or more commands to one or more components using a `Map[ComponentRef, Set[ControlCommand]`. The utility handles subscribing for 
final completion result for all the commands post successful validation and get an aggregated response of completion as `Completed` if all the commands 
were successfully completed. An `Error` response is returned otherwise.
