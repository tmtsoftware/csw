### Api changes
- CommandService
    - `submit` now returns its initial response (e.g. `Started`) instead of waiting for the final response 
    - Added `submitAndWait` which will submit the command and wait for its final response
    - Rename `submitAll` to `submitAllAndWait` in Command service as it waits for final response of all commands
- `Prefix` creation will throw `NoSuchElementException` if invalid subsystem is provided
- Replaced `ActorRef` with ActorRef `URI` in `AkkaRegistration`
